# Leppotone Electrical Recordings
This is our temporary headquarters. Please pardon our dust.

## What's A Leppotone?
Spiking the punch and punching the clock for over 20 years, Leppotone releases recordings and hosts all sorts of bacchanlia. 

Leppotone, born Leppotone Electrical Recordings, is Kalamazoo's oldest record label. Although frequently on hiatus for various reasons, Leppotone continues to make and do interesting things on a schedule known only to the Colonel, himself.
