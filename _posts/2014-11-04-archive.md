> What happened to the old site?

It was maintained by a single human volunteer. Eventually this volunteer burned out on security patches, PHP version issues and unfulfilled feature requests. A static HTML archive of the old site was made in November 2014.

We are currently looking for a place to host the two gigabytes of words found in our old Leppotone Family Forum. 

When we find a home for the archive, we will provide a link here.
